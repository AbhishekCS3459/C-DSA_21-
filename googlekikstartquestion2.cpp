// lasyana is given the no of visitors at her local theme park on N consesecutive days,
// The no of visitors on the ith day is Vi.A day is record breaking if it satisfies both of the following conditions:
// 1) The no of visistors on the day is strictly larger than the no of visitors on each of the previous days.
// 2) Either it is the last day,or the no of visitors on the day is strictly larger than the no of visitors on the following day.
// Note that very first day could be a record breaking day!
// Find the no of record breaking days.
// Exa- 1,2,0,7,2,0,2,2 - here arr[1],arr[3] are record breaking days
// Brute force: Iterate over all the elements and check if it is record element or not
// Here we have to use time complexity of this opreation is O(n)
// Overall time complexity is O(n2){we cant afford this much time}
// Optimised apporach:
// 1) We need to check if arr[i]>{arr[i-1],arr[i-2].....},
// which is same as arr[i]>max(all the previous elements)
// mx - stores the max till arr[i]
// 2) if arr[i]>arr[i+1] for i+1<n and update the max,mx=max(mx,arr[i])
// We have to validate these two conditions
